"from
"https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Make_Vim_completion_popup_menu_work_just_like_in_an_IDE 
"These should improve autocomplete 
"The first step to "improve" the menu behavior is to execute this command:
"
set completeopt=longest,menuone
"
"The above command will change the 'completeopt' option so that Vim's popup
"menu doesn't select the first completion item, but rather just inserts the
"longest common text of all matches; and the menu will come up even if there's
"only one match. (The longest setting is responsible for the former effect and
"the menuone is responsible for the latter.)
"
"The next enhancement is the following mapping:
"
inoremap <expr> <CR> pumvisible() ? "\<C-y>" : "\<C-g>u\<CR>"
"
"The above mapping will change the behavior of the <Enter> key when the popup
"menu is visible. In that case the Enter key will simply select the
"highlighted menu item, just as <C-Y> does.
"
"These two mappings further improve the completion popup menu:
"
inoremap <expr> <C-n> pumvisible() ? '<C-n>' :
  \ '<C-n><C-r>=pumvisible() ? "\<lt>Down>" : ""<CR>'

inoremap <expr> <M-,> pumvisible() ? '<C-n>' :
  \ '<C-x><C-o><C-n><C-p><C-r>=pumvisible() ? "\<lt>Down>" : ""<CR>'

"In the above mappings, the first will make <C-N> work the way it normally
"does; however, when the menu appears, the <Down> key will be simulated. What
"this accomplishes is it keeps a menu item always highlighted. This way you
"can keep typing characters to narrow the matches, and the nearest match will
"be selected so that you can hit Enter at any time to insert it. In the above
"mappings, the second one is a little more exotic: it simulates <C-X><C-O> to
"bring up the omni completion menu, then it simulates <C-N><C-P> to remove the
"longest common text, and finally it simulates <Down> again to keep a match
"highlighted.
